#hi.  

This is my vim setup! I use a handful of plugins:

* [Ctrl-P](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim)
* [Go](https://github.com/fatih/vim-go.git)
* [EasyMotion](https://github.com/easymotion/vim-easymotion)
* [MatchTag](https://github.com/gregsexton/MatchTag)
* [NerdTree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree.git)
* [Numbers](https://github.com/myusuf3/numbers.vim.git)
* [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)
* [RainbowParentheses](https://github.com/kien/rainbow_parentheses.vim.git)
* [Scala](https://github.com/derekwyatt/vim-scala.git)
* [Surround](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround.git)
* [YouCompleteMe](http://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe.git)

### Installation:
Simply clone the repository into the ~/.vim folder:

`> git clone https://github.com/heathsd/vim.git ~/.vim`

Once the clone has completed, run the "execute.sh"

`> sh execute.sh`

After all the submodules have been installed you have to compile YouCompleteMe, instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe).
